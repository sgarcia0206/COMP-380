Project Topic!

4. A software that performs simple E-commerce site for a “abc” sales Company. The functions include searching for
an item, order, including shipping methods; pay an item using credit card etc. Confirmation of the purchase
should be sent to the user’s email address.

Project Description

Objectives
  • Experience completing independent / investigative research on a given problem domain to find the appropriate
solution necessary. You will be required to learn about the domain of your problem, discover possible solutions,
and implement one.
  • Apply learned skills in RAD and Object-Oriented Analysis, Design and Implementation
  • Implementation skills:
    o Proper styling and commenting of code
    o Use JAVA/ Python/C#, etc. APIs
    o Generate documentation for the development team
  • User interface design
    o Incorporate a user-friendly GUI front-end
  • Basic Software Engineering, including
    o Implementing a test plan with high coverage using a test framework in a specific programming language
that you use in your project
o Writing documentation for the user
o Writing basic technical documentation for the design team
o (Optional) Incorporating software revision control throughout
• Agile Development
o Meet regularly with client to give feedback on project progress, challenges, etc.
o Refactor
o Test-driven development (TDD) through aggressive and frequent unit, integration and validation testing
• Discuss your problem and solution intelligently in a presentation.
The project involves the following steps and in each step there will be documentation templates your group will need to
complete. The steps are:
Step 1: Requirements of the project
Analyze the problem and discuss the functional, performance and any other requirements that your project will satisfy
Step 2: Specification of the project
Write the specification of your project based on your requirements using Agile and OO Methods
Step 3: Design of the project
Write the design of your project based on your specification using Agile and OO Methods
Step 4: Implementation
You are expected to incorporate at least some amount of object oriented (OO) programming in your implementation,
you may use OO programming languages such as JAVA, C#, Python (OO), PHP (OO), etc. You may choose C++, but it can
be a lot more work to design GUI in C++.
Many of the elements of this course are OO such as UML class diagram, OO design patterns, refactoring in context of OO
code. Having OO component to your code shall deepen your skill of OO Software Engineering.
You are expected to use version control system such as GIT.
You should not use low code or no code platforms for implementation. One of the goals is to help you deepen your
coding experience as expected from a CS major. Low code platform will not help you with that goal.
Step 5: Testing
Use the testing methods for unit, integration and validation tests.
Step 6: Operation (User Manual)
Write a brief user manual that guides users on how to use your software application
